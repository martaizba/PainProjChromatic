# Overview 
This project showcases my basic React skills through the development of a functional React component. The primary goal is to demonstrate the ability to build a component from scratch, integrate it with Storybook for an interactive UI development environment, and utilize Chromatic for visual regression testing.

# Features
-Functional React Component: A custom React component that serves a specific function, illustrating the use of React hooks and state management.
-Storybook Integration: The component is added to Storybook, providing a sandbox environment for visual testing and interaction.
-Chromatic Testing: Visual regression tests are conducted using Chromatic to ensure the component's visual integrity across updates.
